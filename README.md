# Tom Lyne asynchronous code example

This is the synchronous/asynchronous baking demo I used in the tech talk

There are various scenarios that show bakers baking synchronously, asyncronously,
or even baking in the same oven at the same time

Comment out various scenarios in main.go to see how they play out!

To run:

`go run ./src`
